We've always been generating lots of lonely young men. That's kind of the point of traditional masculinity, which benefits rich and powerful men, but fucks up every other man by making them expendable little pawns to be used in pointless wars and dangerous work environments (look up the gendered stats for war and workplace fatalities, it's fun). A huge part of being expendable is not having a healthy social network. If you aren't well-loved by your friends and family, people won't miss you when you're gone.

The left did a lot to free women from toxic gender norms. It did, however, fuck all to do the same for men. Hell, it barely even acknowledges that toxic gender norms for men even exist. And when it does, it only acknowledges them as toxic because it harms people of other genders, not because it harms men themselves.

Now, we have millions of men all across the world who can feel that there is something deeply wrong about their gender - about how society treats them because of their gender. But without support from anyone who would help them question these things in a healthy way, they become easy marks for grifters.

Instead of recognizing that the "crisis of masculinity" is being caused by traditional male gender norms fucking up their social lives and mental health exactly as they're intended, they become convinced that it's because society is not allowing them to be masculine enough. And that the solution is for them to reinforce conventional male gender norms even more.

It's a great racket for the grifters because they're literally trying to cure poison by selling more poison. You're guaranteed to make a lot of money when the bullshit cure you're selling is the literal source of the disease you're trying to cure.

Yeah this was the thing that when pointed out to me made me rethink some of the typical complaints you hear. Even when men are suffering we don't actually care about that for men's sake, we care about the effects it will have on society as a whole.

Or worse, it’s framed as solely a political challenge. “Young men aren’t voting Democract, how do we fix that?”

The right offers bullshit answers to men’s problems, but at least acknowledges they exist, and even if they’re crazy, a lot of figures on the alt-right pipeline seem to genuinely believe the problems and the solutions are real. The left struggles to even acknowledge that men even matter on their own terms, or that they have their own problems.

You pretend troubled people have no problems, shame them for talking about them, and frequently go farther and pile the world’s problems on their shoulders … and wonder why they are ripe for an alternative to pluck them?

The only surprise is that it’s taken this long.

> Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they've ever known.

- Hillary Clinton

I always think of this quote when we talk about what you just pointed out, that even in problems that heavily affect men, we only talk about their effects insofar as they impact other groups. Men aren't even allowed to be the primary victims when they die on the battlefield.

Борьба за права женщин разрушила традиционные гендерные роли, и если для женщин это было освобождением от оков, у мужчин это отняло направление в жизни. Единственные способы с этим бороться, которые я вижу, это либо дать им это направление создав новую маскулинность, либо, что обещают правые популисты, забрать права у женщин. Рано или поздно одно из этих решений воплотится.

There is always more pussy.
