Republicans are, Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.

And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.

Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements, still away.
